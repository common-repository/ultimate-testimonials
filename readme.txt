== Description ==

The only testimonials plugin you'll ever need! Fully functional features include front end testimonial submission, random testimonials, and a built-in ratings system.

Create beautiful testimonials and display them via shortcodes, widgets, or a fixed URL (e.g. yoursite.com/testimonials).

Ultimate Testimonials is an all-in-one solution for adding testimonials to your site. Create them very quickly and easily via the dedicated testimonials editor, then optionally add them to one or more testimonial groups for flexible display options. Each testimonial can belong to a single group, multiple groups, or no groups.

Display testimonials anywhere on your site. e.g. headers, footers, sidebars, or in posts and pages!

Easily create a new testimonial via the dedicated editor and include all the information you want to display such as:

- Title
- Message
- Excerpt
- Image
- Company/website
- Author
- Rating
- Template (range of templates available)

Add a testimonial image by uploading an image via the testimonial editor, or by optionally specifying a Gravatar email to associate an image with a testimonial.

There are several ways to display the testimonials you've created. Use shortcodes to display individual testimonials, or groups of testimonials anywhere on your site. Or, use the dedicated widget to show a group of testimonials in a sidebar, header, or footer (depending on what widget areas your current theme supports).

Alternatively, there are permalink URLs available to display single testimonials or testimonial archives (all testimonials or only those from specific groups). These URLs look something like:

- yoursite.com/testimonials (<= Displays all testimonials)
- yoursite.com/testimonials/main (<= Displays all testimonials from the 'main' group)
- yoursite.com/testimonial/my-testimonial (<= Displays the individual testimonial with slug name 'my-testimonial')
